# Who-Does-What (WDW)
This is a web-based application supporting to create an insider contacts list of the international organisation.

## Introduction
This project is creating an application (Who-Does-What aka WDW) that provides a simple interface to find the desired contact details from the jungle.

##### Problem Statement:
The common human resources applications are generally displaying employees, their titles, the organisation / team belonging to. Also their reporting line and organisational hierarchy could be visible. However it is not easy to find the correct person and responsible team from other side of the world.

Further more restructuring in local scope as well as new hires and leavers, it is almost impossible to keep all employees up to date.

##### Solution:
A platform that enables organising the team contact details including few managed tags. Those are helping a constructive searching, and an easy filtering.

At same time gives administrative users to maintain the changes instantly which reflects for all users straightaway. Any small changes such as a restructure in local scope, a promoted team leader, are reflected easily.
